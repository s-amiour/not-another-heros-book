# Not Another Hero's Book

This project follows a microservice architecture where Flask acts as a headless content API and Django acts as the gameplay engine and user-facing application.








my own notes (sultan):
## Flask comms
``` bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-cors
```
